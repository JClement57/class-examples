== To Run this Application

To run this application, you will first have to set up the database.
Follow these steps:

. Clone or refresh the `examples-db` repository from Github.
. Create a database file that matches the value of the `DATABASE` variable
  near the top of the `db.py` file.
  Make sure to create the file in the _same_ directory where `db.py` itself is located.
. From the `db` directory, run the `create-db.sql` script to create the database tables.
  You should be able to right-click on the file and choose `Run`.
. Similarly, run the `init-db.sql` script.

Now you should be able to run the application:

. Open the `examples-db.py` file.
. Right click anywhere in the `examples.py` window,
  and choose either `Run` or `Debug`.
